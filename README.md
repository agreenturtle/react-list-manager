React Project that allows a user to create multiple lists and list items for each list. Once a list item has been added, it can be crossed off or deleted. Each list can also be deleted. The app will not allow an empty task title or list item to be entered in.

To Use:

1. Enter the Task's title (ie "Shopping List" or "Ingredients") and click the "Add New Task" button.
2. Enter in the List Items (ie "Apple", "Pear") and click the "Add" button
3. To cross off an item, select the check box next to the list item.
4. To remove a list item, click the "x" by the list item
5. To remove a Task, click the "x" at the top of the box.
